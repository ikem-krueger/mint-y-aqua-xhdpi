# Mint-Y-Aqua (xhdpi)

Linux Mint 21.3 Xfce is missing a high dpi window manager theme.

This is my attempt to fix that.

This theme is based on [mmolch-xfce (xhdpi)](https://github.com/mmolch/mmolch-xfce).

## Installation

Click on "Code" and "Download ZIP".

Extract the zip-file:

- user folder: `~/.local/share/themes`
- system folder: `/usr/share/themes` (needs root permissions)

Open "Settings Manager" > "Window Management" and choose "Mint-Y-Aqua (xhdpi)".
